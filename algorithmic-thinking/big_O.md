## Worst Case

- Express time-complexity in both "best case" and "worst case" scenarios

## Space Complexity

- Specific to how much *additional* space is required by a function independent of the input

## Limitations

- The constants don't matter when representing time- or space-complexity in Big-O notation, but they do matter (or, they can)
- An optimization that divides runtime by 5 (O(n) vs O(n/5)) is still important if the base runtime takes anything longer than milliseconds
- Sometimes optimization is less important than writing code that works and is quicker to ship or easier to understand
- Develop the skill to see optimizations, and the wisdom to judge if they're worthwhile
